# HACKATHON
## Hachathon overview
use only html and css to create a personal portfolio project

## What I was going for
I was going for a minimalistic style

## Key concepts
I used glass morphism for my containers to give it that glassy look
I used width(min()) to make the website responsive to different screen sizes
